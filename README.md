This is a proof of concept prototype for a ground service module for the free flight simulatior FlightGear. Unlike some exisiting ground services
which are part of various aircraft, it is intended to be generic and not dependant on specific aircrafts (though there will be dependencies from aircraft dimensions).
It currently only moves ground vehicles along an airports taxiways without providing any services.
It is written completely in Nasal and is derived/inspired from the existing AI subsystem and tanker.nas (except for the way vehicles are moving).
